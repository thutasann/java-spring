# **How to Master LeetCode and Grind Effectively**

## **1. Build a Strong Foundation**

Before grinding LeetCode, make sure you understand:

- **Data Structures**: Arrays, HashMaps, Trees, Graphs, Stacks, Queues, Heaps, Linked Lists, Tries
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, Recursion, Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Binary Search, Dynamic Programming, Backtracking

## **2. Follow a Structured Roadmap**

Start with **easy** problems, then move to **medium**, and finally **hard** problems.

### **Step-by-Step Plan**

### âœ… **Step 1: Learn Patterns Instead of Memorizing**

Master **common patterns** like:

- **Sliding Window** (e.g., Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters)
- **Two Pointers** (e.g., Valid Palindrome)
- **Prefix Sum / HashMap** (e.g., Subarray Sum Equals K)
- **Binary Search** (e.g., Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array)
- **Dynamic Programming** (e.g., House Robber, Longest Increasing Subsequence)

### âœ… **Step 2: Solve Easy-Medium Problems First**

Follow **Blind 75** or **NeetCode 150** problem lists.

### âœ… **Step 3: Solve Variations of Problems**

For each problem type, solve **3-5 similar questions** to reinforce the pattern.

### âœ… **Step 4: Time Yourself & Optimize Solutions**

- Aim for **brute force first**, then optimize using a **better approach**.
- If you can't optimize, **study the solution** and try to implement it from scratch.

### âœ… **Step 5: Track Progress & Revisit Hard Problems**

- Maintain a **spreadsheet** to track solved problems and approaches used.
- If you struggle with a problem, **redo it after a week**.

## **3. Grinding Strategy**

### **Beginner (0-100 problems)**

- Solve **easy problems (Arrays, HashMaps, Two Pointers, Sliding Window)**
- Focus on **understanding basic data structures**
- **Target: 1-2 problems per day**

### **Intermediate (100-300 problems)**

- Start **Medium problems** with **Recursion, DFS/BFS, Prefix Sum**
- Learn **Dynamic Programming basics** (bottom-up & top-down)
- **Target: 2-3 problems per day**

### **Advanced (300+ problems)**

- Focus on **Graph algorithms, Tries, Segment Trees**
- Solve **Hard problems**
- Optimize code and explain solutions in mock interviews
- **Target: 3-5 problems per day**

## **4. Use the Right Tools**

- **NeetCode 150 / Blind 75** â†’ Structured problem list
- **LeetCode Discuss** â†’ Learn optimized solutions
- **Codeforces / AtCoder** â†’ For speed and problem-solving skills
- **Mock Interviews** â†’ Practice under pressure

---

## **5. Mindset & Discipline**

- **Consistency beats cramming** â€“ Solve problems **daily**
- **Donâ€™t be afraid to fail** â€“ Learn from mistakes and **debug code**
- **Explain solutions out loud** â€“ Helps with interviews
- **Take breaks** â€“ Avoid burnout

ðŸ”¥ **Grind smart, not just hard!** ðŸš€
