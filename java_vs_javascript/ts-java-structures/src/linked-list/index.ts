 * - A linked list is like a skyscraper with no elevators. To get to the floor you’re looking for, you need to climb up the stairs one level at a time. In an array, you can press a button that takes you right to the floor you need to get to.
 * - Same as the reason above, insertion and deletion of data in a linked list doesn’t require re-indexing the entire list, which makes it faster than inserting or deleting data in an array
